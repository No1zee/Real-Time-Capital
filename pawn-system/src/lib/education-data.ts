            <h2>The Art of Valuation</h2>
            <p>Valuing art is both a science and an art. Unlike gold or currency, which have fixed market rates, art value is subjective and influenced by trends, provenance, and condition.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Provenance is Key</h3>
            <p>The history of ownership can significantly impact value. A piece owned by a celebrity or exhibited in a major museum carries a premium.</p>

            <h3>2. Condition Matters</h3>
            <p>Any damage, restoration, or fading can devalue a piece. Mint condition works always command the highest prices.</p>

            <h3>3. Market Trends</h3>
            <p>Artist popularity fluctuates. We monitor global auction results (Sotheby's, Christie's) to value your item against real-world sales data.</p>

            <h2>Your Intellectual Property is an Asset</h2>
            <p>Musicians, authors, and content creators often sit on valuable catalogs. You don't need to sell your rights to get capital.</p>

            <h3>How IP Loans Work</h3>
            <p>We analyze your trailing 12-month revenue (Spotify streams, AdSense, Royalties). Based on the stability of this income, we offer a lump sum loan.</p>

            <h3>What We Accept</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Music Royalties (BMI, ASCAP statements)</li>
                <li>YouTube Channel Revenue</li>
                <li>Patents and Trademarks</li>
            </ul>
